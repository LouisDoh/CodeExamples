# CodeExamples

A collection of basic code examples for C++ topics.

To use these code examples, create a new project/solution in Visual Studio and select the option to clone a remote repository. Provide the URL for this repo to make a local copy.

Once you've loaded your local copy, you can easily choose which project to run in the solution by right clicking the solution (at the top of your hierarchy in the right pane), selecting the 'Set startup projects' option from the list, and clicking the 'Current Project' radio button. Once you've done this, you can run different example projects by just clicking the desired project and pressing the green play button ("Start without debugging (Ctrl+F5)"). Your currently selected project will be in bold text on the hierarchy in the right pane.

Let me know if you spot any issues and I will make a change to fix it :)
